# Intelligent Discord Bot

Update as of 3-27-2020: There's not much here right now, mostly because
the bot isn't "intelligent" right now. Ultimately, the goal is to have
this bot contain the following features:

1) Be able to impersonate me through discord, through some form of
   machine learning. This means it will be able to speak like me & "think"
   like me in similar fashions, at a similar rate. This is the ultimate
   end goal.
   
2) Have Universal functionality, meaning that all other types of bots
   (music bots, etc) that are more "general" bots will/would no longer
   be required.
